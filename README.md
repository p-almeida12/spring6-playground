# Spring6 Playground

This repository is a web application built using Spring Boot 3 / Spring Framework 6, used to test
and get to know some of its features.

## Spring Boot 3 / Spring Framework 6

Spring boot is a tool used to easily create stand-alone Spring based applications, with features
like autoconfiguration, embedded web servers, starters and many other tools. I like to think about 
it has a wrapper around Spring. [[1]](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#overview)

Spring Framework on the other hand, is a widely used open-source framework for building enterprise
level Java applications, meaning that they are highly scalable and reliable, with a lot of 
features that makes the development of these applications a lot easier. [[2]](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
